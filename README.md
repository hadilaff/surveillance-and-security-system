# surveillance-and-security-system
Flutter application for monitoring using a Raspberry Pi camera

It is a mobile surveillance and security application developed using Dart.
If the PIR motion sensor detects movement, it sends an 'alert' notification to our application, captures an image, and stores it in Firebase. 
Additionally, there is another feature where the user can access the camera in real-time.
